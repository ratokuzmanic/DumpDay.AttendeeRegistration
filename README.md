# Attendee registration app

Web application for registering attendees and printing their accreditations. The application was built for and used at:
* [DUMP Day](https://day.dump.hr) held at Split, Croatia on June 4th, 2016
* [DUMP Days](https://2017.days.dump.hr/) held at Split, Croatia during May 5th and 6th, 2017   
   
The application has been discontinued since due to my departure from the association. The latest version that was used at the event is available as [v1.0 release](https://github.com/ratokuzmanic/DumpDays.AttendeeRegistration/releases/tag/v1.0). Further updates are exclusively in a function of personal tinkering and experimenting.
